# Python_Projects_Phone_Number_and_Email_Address_Extractor
Problem Defn : Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email address in a 
section of a popular blog. If you manually scroll through the page, you might end up searching 
for a long time. But if you had a program that could search the text in your clipboard for phone 
numbers and email addresses, you could simply press ctrl-A to select all the text, press ctrl-C to 
copy it to a .txt file, and then run your program. It would fetch just the phone numbers and email 
addresses it finds and write them to another .txt file. Code such a script.
